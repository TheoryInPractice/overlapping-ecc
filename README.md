# README

This folder contains code for algorithms and experiments for the WebConference 2019 submission: "Clustering in graphs and hypergraphswith categorical edge labels."

Nearly all code is written in Julia (run with version 1.1.1). The only exception is that  for Experiment 5.3, we also installed Graclus and use the Matlab interface.
